<p id="para">Hypertext Markup Language is the standard markup language for documents 
designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and 
scripting languages such as JavaScript.JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement 
complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information 
for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video 
jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard
web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.
JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate 
images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines 
of JavaScript code.)APIs are ready-made sets of code building blocks that allow a developer to implement programs that 
would otherwise be hard or impossible to implement. They do the same thing for programming that ready-made furniture 
kits do for home building — it is much easier to take ready-cut panels and screw them together to make a bookshelf than
it is to work out the design yourself, go and find the correct wood, cut all the panels to the right size and shape, 
find the correct-sized screws, and then put them together to make a bookshelf.</p>
